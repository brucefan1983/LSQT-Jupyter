# LSQT-Jupyter
A tutorial on the linear scaling quantum transport methods using Jupyter (with the Python 3 kernel)

* `LSQT-Jupyter` is a Jupyter notebook demonstrating some practical apects of the linear-scaling quantum transport methods reviewd in Ref. [1]. I will refer to this reference frequently for the relevant theoretical backgrounds.
* This code is only suitable for learning the methods. For high performance computing, check the `GPUQT` code I wrote: https://github.com/brucefan1983/gpuqt
* This code only considers square lattice with Anderson disoder as the model system. For more general simulations, again check the `GPUQT` code.
* For fans of `Matlab`, check the `lsqt-matlab` code I wrote: https://github.com/brucefan1983/lsqt-matlab
